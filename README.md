# CraigslistJobFeed
A job feed based on a link from the search results on Craigslist.
[Here is a video of the job feed running.](https://youtu.be/C0OFysoDm7A)

How this started was with me actually trying to learn more JavaScript so I could utilize the Puppeteer library for a better 'shoe bot'.
Through the various resources I consumed on JavaScript and Puppeteer, I saw an example that produced a similar result that I have but in a trivial example.
This reminded me of all the times I had been job searching in the past and that I always wanted a 'job feed' based on a location and/or title.

The project starts by first searching for a job title (ie: 'analyst') and then selecting a maximum distance from a zip code (20 miles from 98101) - if you want.
Once you see the results of your search: copy and paste the url you have and replace the existing one already in the project.

Save the project and then it should be all set to run.
